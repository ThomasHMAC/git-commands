to syn with a remote git respitory when you forked it to your local respitory.
1. git remote add upstream the URL of remote git respitory
2. git remote -v : check the status 
3. gt fetch upstream : will create branch of local master into upstream/master
4. git merge upstream/master: this will merge whatever changes in the upstream respitory to your local git respitory!
5. Sometimes when you merge there are conflict since that git can not automically merge the files, hence you have to do this manually by git add . (add whatever changes you have make or has the upstream respitory make then git commit -m).
